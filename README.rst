    Add a short description here!



This repository contains work realised in the frame of my master thesis conducted at DTU Wind & Energy systems. Goal was to developp a AI powered combinatorial electricity market based on the MLICA algorithm.
The ML - ICA (Machine learning Iterative Combinatorial Auctions) mechanism is extensively described in :

Code is adapted from the original implementation of the MLICA algorithm by the authors of [1], [2] and [3] available at https://github.com/weissteiner/DL-ICA
